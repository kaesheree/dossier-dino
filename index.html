            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Zalmoxes is a Small Ornithopod</strong> dinosaur that was discovered by David
                Weishample, Coralia-Maria Jianu, Zoltan Csiki & David Bruce Norman in 2003. It lived in the Late
                Cretaceous era, about 69 million years ago. It belongs to the species of Ornithopod, a family that
                started out as small, two-legged dinosaurs and soon became one of the most populated species of
                herbivorous dinosaurs.

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p> Often occupying central Europe, these dinosaurs could be found in countries such as Romania, Southern
                France, and Northern Spain. These dinosaurs often inhabited places such as rainforests as well.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Features of a Zalmoxes</h2>
            <p>Zalmoxes were often identified as having long legs, long tails, and a short neck. When they communicated,
                like most dinosaurs, they did so through hoots and hollers. They reproduced by laying eggs down, much
                like other dinosaurs as well. Their fossils often had narrow beaks, slightly pointed skulls, and 3-toed
                feet. Zalmoxes were found to be about 7-10 feet in length, weighing up to 500 lbs.

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>
                Many researchers found that Zalmoxes did not have long lifespans. Another interesting fact about them is
                that they were often found to be 2-3 in feet, being dwarfs. Finally, they were named after an ancient
                European diety.

                <h2>Classification</h2>
                <p>The suborder of a zalmoxes dinosaur is theropoda, while the order is dinosauria. Its subclass is
                    considered tyrannosauroidea, with its class being ornithopods. For its phylum, its chordata and
                    dinosauria. It belonged to the kingdom of animalia and lived during the late cretaceous era.</p>
